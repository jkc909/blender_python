# blender_python
Just messing around with Blender 3D and Python. In this example I am creating a 3D model of an Elektron Analog Rytm through Python scripting.

### instructions
For a quick preview, I've provided a screenshot of the project and the scripts in .py format.

To view the main project file: download the repo and either open the .blend file or run the script provided in Blender. You'll need to place the trace image in the directory of your current Blender session.
